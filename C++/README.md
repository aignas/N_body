C++ version of the code
=======================

This is the C++ implementation of the code, which will use the GSL
library and it should be fun... :)

I'll be using cmake just for fun...

TODO:
    1. Implement vectors in my program.
    2. Update the function Force to work with vectors up to 3
       dimensions.
    3. Implement a simple Euler algorithm.
    4. Use GSL to implement Euler algorithm.
    5. Use GSL to implement RK4 algorithm.
