N_body
======

N-body simulator concept

The plan of attack is:

    1. F = mmG/r^3 * vec(r) implementation

    2. Euler method of solving a differential eq. for a particle in a potential field

    3. RK4 method of above

    4. Non central fields and many bodies

    5. Barnes-Hut partition algorithm
